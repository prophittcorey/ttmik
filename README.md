# TTMIK

This is a browser plugin that improves the TTMIK
([talktomeinkorean.com](https://talktomeinkorean.com))
website.

A common complaint for TTMIK users is the use of romanization within the early
levels (1 through 3). This extension's primary goal was to remove the
romanization from levels 1, 2 and 3.

At this time no additional improvements are made, but may be added if the
community deems them necessary.
